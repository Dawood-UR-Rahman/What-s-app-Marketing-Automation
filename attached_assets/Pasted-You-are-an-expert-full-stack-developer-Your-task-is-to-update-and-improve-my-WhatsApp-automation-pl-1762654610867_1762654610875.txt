You are an expert full-stack developer.
Your task is to update and improve my WhatsApp automation platform.
Read all requirements below carefully and implement the updates.

✅ Current System Overview

The system allows users to add multiple WhatsApp accounts by scanning QR codes.

All connected WhatsApp accounts appear as cards on the Connections Page.

Each card has a Settings button where the user sets a Webhook URL for that individual WhatsApp number.

There is a Message Dashboard where the user selects a WhatsApp account and sees all related messages.

Users can send text, image, and link messages from the dashboard and via API endpoints.

A Webhook is used to receive incoming messages and message statuses.

✅ What you need to implement (System Updates)
1. Add Interactive Reply Buttons Support

Add support for sending interactive messages:

Send reply buttons manually from the dashboard UI.

Send reply buttons via API.

API must allow sending a custom unique message_id for every outgoing message.

2. Reply Tracking in Webhook

When a user replies to an interactive button:

Webhook must include:

The reply details

The original message_id
This allows external systems to track conversations accurately.

3. Update API Message Types

Add/Update API endpoints to support:

Text messages

Image messages

Link messages

Interactive reply button messages

Optional custom message_id for tracking

Webhook must return message_id in all replies.

4. Real-Time Message Notifications

Add notification system:

When new message received:

Show a notification badge on the message table.

If user is on another tab, show a notification on the tab title and play a small beep sound.

When user opens the message:

Remove the badge and stop notifications.

5. Fix Settings Icon in Connection Cards

On the dashboard connection cards:

Make sure the Settings icon works exactly as it does on the connection page.

It must open the proper settings modal for each WhatsApp account.

6. Delete Connection Properly

When user deletes a WhatsApp account:

Remove the connection from the database.

Remove related data from localStorage.

Ensure no old data causes issues when reconnecting the same number.

7. Add API Access Token

In the Settings for each WhatsApp account:

Add a field where user can set an API Access Token.

If token is set → All API requests must validate the token.

If no token → API should still allow sending messages (backward compatible).

8. Create a Developer Documentation Page

Create a client-friendly documentation page containing:

How to send messages using API (text, image, link, interactive buttons).

How to pass custom message_id.

Webhook structure with message_id in replies.

Authentication using API Access Token.

Example JSON requests & responses.

Error handling, rate limits, and guidelines.

✅ Final Output Requirements

Return the following:

Updated system architecture

All new API endpoints (with request & response examples)

Webhook response structure

UI/UX improvements code/design plan

Code samples for sending interactive buttons

Instructions for deleting connections correctly
