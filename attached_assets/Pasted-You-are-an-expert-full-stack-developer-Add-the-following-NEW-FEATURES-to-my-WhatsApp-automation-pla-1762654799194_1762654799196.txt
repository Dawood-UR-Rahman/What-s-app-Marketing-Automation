You are an expert full-stack developer.
Add the following NEW FEATURES to my WhatsApp automation platform.
Do not ask about the old system — just implement exactly what is listed below.

✅ New Features to Add
1. Interactive Reply Buttons

Add the ability to send interactive reply buttons from the dashboard UI.

Add API support for sending interactive reply buttons.

API must allow sending a custom unique message_id with every message.

2. Reply Tracking in Webhook

When a user taps a reply button:

Webhook must return the reply content.

Webhook must also include the original message_id so external systems can track replies.

3. Updated API Message Types

Add API capability for sending:

Text messages

Image messages

Links

Interactive button messages

Optional custom message_id

Webhook responses must always return message_id and status.

4. Real-Time Notifications

Add message notification features:

Notification badge on the message table when new messages arrive.

If user is on another browser tab, show a tab notification and play a short alert sound.

When the user views the message, clear the notification badge.

5. Fix Settings Icon

Fix the Settings icon on the dashboard connection cards so it opens the correct settings modal for each WhatsApp account.

6. Proper Connection Delete

When a user deletes a connection:

Delete it from database.

Delete all related data from localStorage.

Ensure reconnection works without leftover cached data.

7. API Access Token

Add a field in connection settings:

User can set an API Access Token.

If token exists → API must validate it.

If no token → API still works without token (backward compatible).

8. Developer Documentation Page

Generate a full documentation page including:

API endpoints (examples included)

Webhook structure with message_id

How to send interactive buttons

How access tokens work

Request/response examples

Error handling and best practices

✅ Final Output Required
